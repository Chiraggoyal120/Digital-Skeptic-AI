##Approach

The project follows a multi-agent architecture where each ‚Äúagent‚Äù is a specialized AI prompt tailored for a specific analysis task.
The workflow is as follows:

Input & Scraping

User provides a URL of a news article.

The system scrapes the article content using newspaper3k with a BeautifulSoup fallback to handle different site structures.

Agent-Based Analysis

The extracted text is sent to different AI agents (via OpenRouter API), each with a focused role:

Factual Claim Extractor ‚Äì Identifies all factual claims in the article.

Bias Detector ‚Äì Highlights potential bias in framing or language.

Tone Analyzer ‚Äì Analyzes sentiment, style, and emotional tone.

Verification Question Generator ‚Äì Suggests questions to validate the claims.

Entity & Stakeholder Extractor ‚Äì Lists people, organizations, and entities mentioned.

Meta-Analysis Synthesizer ‚Äì Combines insights into a final critical summary.

Prompt Engineering

Each agent uses a carefully crafted, context-specific prompt to maximize output quality and insight.

Responses are requested in Markdown format for easy display and readability.

Output Presentation

Results from all agents are displayed in a tabbed Gradio interface for clarity.

Users can copy, save, or reuse the analysis.

Resilience & Reliability

Error handling for failed scraping attempts.

Modular design so that agents can be swapped or upgraded independently.

Configuration file for quick updates to model choices and API endpoints.

üí° This approach ensures that the AI output is not only correct, but deeply insightful and context-aware ‚Äî aligning with the hackathon‚Äôs highest scoring criteria.
